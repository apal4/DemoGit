Git workflow:
Stash, pull, commit, push (git stash apply)

issues arise from not following this workflow!

if you ever have any doubt that files are unsaved
Git checkout -b <name>

 
didn’t pull before force push:
git reset --hard origin/master@{1}
 
pulled and lost a commit
Git reflog
git cherry-pick <id>
git push -f origin master

Any changes that were commited, pushed, or stashed can be easily located

unsaved changes were lost
git fsck --lost-found
for blob in $(git fsck --lost-found | awk ‘$2 == “blob” { print $3 }’); do git cat-file -p $blob > $blob.txt; done


Delete a commit
Git reset HEAD^
Git reset HEAD~


merging commits
Git rebase -i HEAD~*
replace the 'picks' with squash

merge conflicts
gitk
